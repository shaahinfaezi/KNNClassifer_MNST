KNN Classifier Project

Overview

This project implements a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier, utilizing a K-D Tree data structure for efficient nearest neighbor searches. The classifier is designed to perform classification tasks on a dataset, achieving an accuracy of 91% on the test set. The project is written in Python and leverages libraries such as scikit-learn for machine learning and NumPy for numerical computations.

Features
